Mini-Assignment - Type Classification | TMNIST

Find a  "Hello World"  Handwritten Digit Classification (MNIST) tutorial and create a similar tutorial for one of the TMNIST data sets.

The tutorial must be posted on Kaggle associated with the data set you use (see https://www.kaggle.com/nikbearbrown/tmnist-alphabet-94-characters/code Links to an external site.)   Your notebook MUST not be identical to the other notebooks associated with the data.  You can also enter the AI Skunkworks TMINST competition is now up. Hereâ€™s the link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmnist-alphabet-classification  Links to an external site.if you wish.

Grading Rubric

20 points (accuracy)

Minus 1 point for every 1% accuracy below 95% for TMNIST (Typeface MNIST)

Minus 1 point for every 1% accuracy below 90% for TMNIST Alphabet (94 characters) or TMNIST-Glyphs (MNIST Style Glyph images)

 

10 points (Uniqueness)

Up to 10 points may be deducted if your notebook looks too similar to the other notebooks posted (i.e. You will get 10 points if it looks like you wrote it and didn't copy it)

 

20 points (Explanation)

How well did you explain the math, code, and ideas behind your neural network?
